# Coherent-Communication-Channel-Simulator-MATLAB-
Designed a coherent transmitter and receiver communicating over noisy Additive White Gaussian Noise(AWGN) channel using MATLAB.
I used the polar, orthogonal and random generated signal for transmitting 1 and 0, and simulated and plotted the observed and theoretical 
total probability of error, the probability of error when 1 is transmitted and the probability of error when 0 is transmitted, 
as SNR decreases from 0dB to -30 dB. Also, plotted the above cases for non-optimal threshold cases(increased and decreased).
